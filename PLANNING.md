# AI Healthcare Agent - Project Planning

## Project Overview
The AI Healthcare Agent is a web-based application that provides personalized healthcare support by integrating wearable device data, medical records, and user input. It aims to improve patient well-being and reduce the burden on traditional healthcare systems by offering real-time health insights, personalized recommendations, and immediate support.

## Architecture

### System Architecture
We will build a reactive, event-driven architecture using the Akka Java SDK. The system will be composed of multiple interconnected components that work together to provide a cohesive healthcare support system.

### Component Architecture
We'll leverage the following Akka components to implement the system:

#### 1. Event Sourced Entities
- **PatientEntity**: Core domain entity that represents a patient and their health data
- **MedicalRecordEntity**: Stores patient medical history
- Events: HealthMetricRecorded, RecommendationProvided, AlertGenerated

#### 2. Key Value Entities  
- **UserPreferencesEntity**: User settings and notification preferences
- **ThresholdConfigEntity**: Health metric thresholds for alerts

#### 3. Endpoints
- **HealthDataEndpoint (HTTP)**: API for wearable devices to push data
- **PatientQueryEndpoint (HTTP)**: API for patient queries and chat interface
- **MedicalSystemEndpoint (gRPC)**: Integration with EHR systems
- **WebSocketEndpoint**: Real-time communication with the web UI

#### 4. Views
- **PatientHealthView**: Materialized view of patient health data for reporting
- **AlertsView**: Aggregated view of patient alerts
- **RecommendationsView**: View of all recommendations for a patient

#### 5. Workflows
- **HealthMonitoringWorkflow**: Long-running process to monitor patient health metrics
- **WeeklyReportWorkflow**: Process to generate weekly health reports
- **AlertEscalationWorkflow**: Handles alert notifications and escalations

#### 6. Consumers
- **WearableDataConsumer**: Processes incoming wearable device data
- **MedicalRecordConsumer**: Processes updates from EHR systems

#### 7. Timed Actions
- **WeeklyReportScheduler**: Schedules generation of weekly reports
- **HealthCheckScheduler**: Periodically checks health metrics against thresholds

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Akka Java SDK 3.2.3
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **AI/ML Libraries**: TensorFlow Java or similar for health data analysis
- **NLP Processing**: OpenNLP or similar for processing patient queries
- **Database**: Event store for events, Redis or similar for materialized views

### Integration Technologies
- **Healthcare Standards**: FHIR for medical data interoperability
- **API Standards**: REST for most APIs, gRPC for high-performance integrations
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Wearable devices push data through HealthDataEndpoint
   - EHR systems provide data through MedicalSystemEndpoint
   - Users input data and queries through PatientQueryEndpoint

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Raw data is processed by respective consumers
   - Events are generated and persisted to Event Sourced Entities
   - AI models analyze health data and generate insights

3. **Data Output**:
   - Views materialize state for quick access
   - Weekly reports are generated via workflows
   - Alerts are triggered based on thresholds
   - Chat responses are generated based on AI analysis

## Security and Compliance
